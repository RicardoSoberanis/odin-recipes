    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dumplings are a type of traditional food that consists of a dough wrapper filled with a variety of ingredients. They can be steamed, boiled, fried, or pan-fried, depending on the recipe and regional variation. Dumplings are popular in many cultures and cuisines, with notable varieties in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Eastern European cuisines.</p>
    <p>Typically, dumplings feature a filling that can include meats like pork or chicken, seafood, vegetables, or a combination of these. The dough is usually made from flour and water, and it encases the filling, which is often seasoned with spices, herbs, and sauces to enhance its flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g (about 1/2 lb) ground pork</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped cabbage</li>
        <li>2 scallions (or green onions), finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>A small piece of fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 small carrot, grated</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g (about 1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup hot water</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Felling:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Mix the filling:</b> In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, cabbage, scallions, garlic, ginger, carrot, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the dough:</b> In a large bowl, mix the flour with the salt. Gradually add the hot water, stirring continuously, until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li><b>Divide the dough:</b> Divide the dough into small balls, roughly the size of a walnut. Roll each ball into a thin circle, about 8-10 cm (3-4 inches) in diameter.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Dumplings:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Fill the dumplings:</b> Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling well, and pleat the edges if desired to ensure they are tightly closed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook the Dumplings:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Steaming:</b> If you have a steamer, place the dumplings in the steamer (in a single layer) and steam for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Pan-frying:</b> If you prefer to fry them, heat a little oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the dumplings in the skillet and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden and crispy. Then, add a little water (about 1/4 cup), cover with a lid, and steam for another 5-7 minutes until the filling is fully cooked.</li>
    </ol>
