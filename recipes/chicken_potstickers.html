    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken potstickers are a type of dumpling known for their crispy, golden-brown bottoms and tender, flavorful filling. These savory dumplings are often pan-fried to create a deliciously crispy crust and then steamed to ensure the filling is fully cooked. Popular in Chinese cuisine, they are enjoyed with a variety of dipping sauces.</p>
    <p>The filling usually includes ground chicken mixed with vegetables and seasonings, encased in a thin dough wrapper. Potstickers can be served as an appetizer or as part of a main meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g (about 1/2 lb) ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped napa cabbage</li>
        <li>2 scallions (or green onions), finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>A small piece of fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 small mushroom, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g (about 1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup hot water</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Mix the filling:</b> In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, napa cabbage, scallions, garlic, ginger, mushroom, soy sauce, and vegetable oil. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the dough:</b> In a large bowl, mix the flour with the salt. Gradually add the hot water, stirring continuously, until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li><b>Divide the dough:</b> Divide the dough into small balls, roughly the size of a walnut. Roll each ball into a thin circle, about 8-10 cm (3-4 inches) in diameter.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Potstickers:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Fill the potstickers:</b> Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges to seal the potsticker well, and pleat the edges if desired to ensure they are tightly closed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook the Potstickers:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Pan-frying:</b> Heat a little oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the potstickers in the skillet and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden and crispy. Add a little water (about 1/4 cup), cover with a lid, and steam for another 5-7 minutes until the filling is fully cooked.</li>
    </ol>
