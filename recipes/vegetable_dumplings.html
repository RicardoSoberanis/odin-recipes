    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vegetable dumplings are a delightful option for those who prefer a meat-free filling. These dumplings are packed with a variety of fresh vegetables and are typically seasoned with soy sauce and spices. They can be enjoyed steamed, boiled, or pan-fried, and make a great appetizer or main dish.</p>
    <p>The filling for vegetable dumplings often includes ingredients like cabbage, carrots, and mushrooms, offering a healthy and flavorful alternative to meat-based dumplings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped cabbage</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated carrot</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 scallions (or green onions), finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g (about 1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup hot water</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Mix the filling:</b> In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, carrot, mushrooms, garlic, scallions, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the dough:</b> In a large bowl, mix the flour with the salt. Gradually add the hot water, stirring continuously, until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li><b>Divide the dough:</b> Divide the dough into small balls, roughly the size of a walnut. Roll each ball into a thin circle, about 8-10 cm (3-4 inches) in diameter.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Dumplings:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Fill the dumplings:</b> Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling well, and pleat the edges if desired to ensure they are tightly closed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook the Dumplings:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Steaming:</b> If you have a steamer, place the dumplings in the steamer (in a single layer) and steam for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Pan-frying:</b> Heat a little oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the dumplings in the skillet and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden and crispy. Add a little water (about 1/4 cup), cover with a lid, and steam for another 5-7 minutes until the filling is fully cooked.</li>
    </ol>
